    <div class="article-body">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>The fate of our society should be determined by the quality of the way we treat each
                other in the smallest acts of daily life, but has the avalanche of daily media cycles made
                us too apathetic towards serious societal issues and events? As a Palestinian American,
                this issue has certainly come to life for Noor, and this interview will include an open
                conversation about this topic in more detail from her perspective.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>Susan Eltell</strong></span>: What big problem in our society today do you wish to clean up?</p><br>
            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>Noor Riyal</strong></span>: The main problem I’m seeing is apathy. 
                Society has become less empathetic towards certain minority groups and the situations they’re facing. An
                example that touches home for me is the apathy towards Palestinians. What I mean by
                that is I’ve heard lines like, “Why should I care if I’m not Palestinian?” Or “This is
                happening across the world; I can’t do anything about it anyways.” This form of apathy
                has been embedded and normalized within our society today. But what a lot may not
                understand is that this very reason is why nothing can be done. As a collective, many
                have chosen to turn a blind eye when, in reality, we are seeing difficult images of
                innocent lives being lost in a long ongoing conflict that has destroyed lives. I think this
                has continued for so long because people who have enough power to actually help are
                choosing to worry about nothing but themselves and their own benefit. We also have
                people who glorify what’s happening in Palestine and believe that Palestinians don’t
                deserve to live or to have their rightfully owned land. All of this leads back to what I said
                in the beginning. Apathy.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="right-article">
            <p>Stereotypes in media and movies have contributed to the apathy shown towards Arabs
                and other minority groups. In many instances and forms of media, they are portrayed as
                the villains that serve as antagonists to the plot. This is not just the case for Arabs but for
                many minorities who’ve suffered negative stereotypes through media portrayal. These
                harmful stereotypes in media have made it a norm to view Arabs and other minority
                groups in a bad light, which leads to dehumanization. This lack of humanization is
                evident in the global reactions to what is happening in Gaza right now and how the
                bombardment of negative portrayals have almost made it a norm to paint Arabs as “the
                enemy” and applaud at their destruction.</p>

        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Would you say that decades of negative portrayals have led us to this point of
                disregard for Arab lives?</p><br>
            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>NR</strong></span>: This is such a good point to bring up. In my opinion, I definitely do think that the
                notion of Arabs being dangerous and threats in the news and media has a lot to do with
                the apathy that we face even when we see videos surfacing out of Gaza. The harmful
                portrayals of Arabs have made it a lot harder to get people to see the actual truth: that
                we are just like any other ethnicity. We are humans. We have families that we hold close
                to our hearts, we have feelings and dreams just like anyone else. However, living in
                America all my life has shown me that we aren’t looked at this way, and it’s because of
                this horrible culture that has been forced in American minds to believe we are the
                opposite and should never be supported or fought for when it comes to basic human
                rights and self-determination.</p><br>
            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: How have these negative portrayals and stereotypes impacted you personally?</p><br>
            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>NR</strong></span>: The stereotypes that have led to the desensitization of Arabs have impacted my life
                in a very negative way. As a Palestinian, I feel as though we don’t receive the same
                human decency that others receive just because of this narrative that’s written of us. I
                have experienced some of the craziest encounters that stick with me to this day. There
                was a time when working in retail, I had someone ask me how I feel about “your people
                being bombed all the time” with the most condescending tone. I don’t let these
                encounters impact my life, and they remind me to be even prouder of where I stem from
                because Palestinians are resilient, and nothing will erase our roots and history.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>Noor’s experience is a great example of keeping your head up in the face of scrutiny, a
                reality that is not unique to Arabs/Palestinians. The interconnectedness of struggle and
                the fight for being seen is one shared with many minority groups who’ve been portrayed
                as the “others” and held under the boot of the “elite.” Stereotypes plague every aspect of
                our society and oftentimes follow us into our personal lives and interactions with others.
                It is the responsibility of an individual to take the appropriate action in combating these
                stereotypes and unlearning the biases they’ve upheld for so long.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">
            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: What ways would you suggest to people so they can educate themselves on
                Palestinian history, or really any social issue, and learn to overcome the embedded
                apathy they’ve been programmed to display?</p><br>
            <p><span class="speaker"><strong>NR</strong></span>: I think in order to combat this and really educate yourself on this matter, it’sbest
                to do your research. Using Palestine as an example, there are so many sources out there
                that explain the existence of Palestine from the very beginning and how the apartheid
                came to be, which is very important to begin with for background knowledge. I also
                highly encourage talking to people who are educated on this matter. So many of us think
                we know enough on our own, but there are others around us who have lived through the
                occupation of Palestine for certain periods of time. For instance, I know how it feels to
                be back home and wake up to the sounds of bombs erupting on the mountain my
                grandparents live on.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>It’s easy to sit here for hours and write about all the people who are apathetic and lack
                the empathy to care, but who wants to do that when you could write about all those
                who’ve stood by you? Even in the darkest times, there are those who believe in you, trust
                you, and fight for you; I think they deserve their mention as well. Every ally comes with
                the message that humanity and empathy are not yet lost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>


        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: We cannot disregard those who have stood with Palestinians and other oppressed
            groups all over the world. What message would you like to give these allies who have
            been our source of camaraderie and community?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>NR</strong></span>: To the allies, I cannot express to you enough, as a Palestinian myself, how grateful
            I am to have a community that sees Palestinians worth fighting for. I know that we put so
            much on the line living in places where if we speak up about this, we may lose
            opportunities, jobs, and so much more, yet you guys still choose to stand strong and
            refuse to remain silent. This topic really hits a sensitive part of my heart, and I just want
            to let allies know that I am grateful to have this community.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>This issue is subject to a lot of scrutiny, and even now, as I write this piece, I find myself
                walking on eggshells and putting the safety and best interest of myself and Noor ahead
                of unfiltered journalism. We live in a polarizing time where everyone is sensitive to the
                issues at hand, often turning on each other to find an outlet. There will always be grey
                areas that leave us confused and uninformed. In the end, I believe common sense,
                humanity, and peace should be the goal for all as we work to clean up the mess and
                rebuild a society built on respect and empathy.</p>
