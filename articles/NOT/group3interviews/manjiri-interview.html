        <div class="left-article">
            <p>When did individualism become isolation? Success become seclusion? Has our society
                become so focused on individual achievements that we’ve lost touch with our sense of
                community? These questions are heavy, and the answers may never be found. It’s the
                natural law for societies to morph as they go through their cycles, locked in an infinite
                spiral and leaving all of us desperately grasping to the debris to keep upright. However,
                recently, we’ve found ourselves void of any ground to stand on while our society spirals
                into a deep-seated era of hyper-individualism, and I’m not the only one who thinks so.
                Manjiri has noticed the hard shift to hyper-individualism that has taken over our
                society, leaving lasting routines that threaten to define the 21st century</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>Susan Eltell</strong></span>: What aspect of our society do you wish you would
            clean up?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>Manjiri Chacharkar</strong></span>: The main problem in our society that I
            would “clean up” is
            hyper-individualism. I think the power of the internet has made everyone more
            individualistic in general, to a point where, collectively, everyone is much more
            self-centered. People are often only concerned with issues that directly affect them. In
            the US especially, you’ll find people arguing with their life over more “first world
            problems” which distracts us from broader issues that affect everyone. Things like
            climate change, gun control, minimum wage, clean water, and America’s homeless crisis
            have become topics that are talked about but quickly forgotten</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: How would you associate this mindset and its implication on
            a societal level, such as
            communicating with others and building communities?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>MC</strong></span>: I definitely think that’s specifically where it all went
            wrong. It started with these
            echo chambers of people yelling, “You don’t owe anyone anything”. People truly do not
            want to look inward, leading to a culture of people unwilling to communicate,
            compromise, sacrifice, or truly advocate for their friends, family, or loved ones without
            thinking, “Do I owe them this?”or “What would I gain from this?”. As humans, we
            physically and mentally cannot survive without human connection, so to sit here as an
            individual and think “I don’t owe anyone anything” while every other person on Earth
            echoes the same thought in their head, is inherently inhuman in my opinion. Frankly,
            it’s probably a civilization-ending phrase.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="right-article">
            <p>Being an active member of society involves taking the initiative to educate yourself on
                certain social and political issues that may not pertain to you personally. Have we fallen
                so far from civilization that we’ve failed to abide by this? Of course, one simply cannot
                be in twenty different places at once. This can take its toll and place internal pressure on
                oneself to be the “perfect spokesperson”; to assume the role many want us to play,
                leading to a level of activism that is, some may say, less authentic. Has the over
                saturation of societal and political issues led to the downfall of interconnectedness?</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Would you say the people who briefly engage in these
            conversations but set them
            aside are being performative?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>MC</strong></span>: I don’t want to be a complete pessimist and say nobody
            cares because I truly do
            believe people, especially our generation, are deeply concerned about these issues.
            However, because most political discourse begins online now, everything has inherently
            become performative. Folks will engage fervently in whatever the new “online
            movement” is, such as BLM or #MeToo or even conversations about Palestine, and then
            quickly forget and move on to the next. Everything feels like it’s for show even though,
            for most people, it’s not intentional. People have forgotten that online advocacy isn’t
            enough and they’ll draw the line at legitimate action.</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Why do you think people hold back from turning online
            advocacy into legitimate
            action?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>MC</strong></span>: I think it’s for a number of reasons. Younger people are
            concerned for their careers
            or of cancel culture. Both are valid concerns, however, it’s also important to remember
            that we are the future employers, CEOs, etc. By beginning to speak out, taking minor
            action, going to protests, starting labor unions, and encouraging people to vote in their
            local elections to try to tackle these “bread and butter” issues, we could build a
            foundation for a future where we wouldn’t be scared into silence.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">
        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>Hesitancy is a common companion to the dark, filthy aspects of our world. With an
                administration set on dismantling the integrity of civilization and a society full of
                hyper-individualistic people, it’s not far off to assume that even the most well-intentioned of us
                struggle with the weight of taking action. The fear of consequences and the uncertainty of the
                impact of our actions perpetuates a cycle of passive advocacy rather than real, tangible change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../../../NOT photos/group3/4.jpg" alt="Image 3">
        </div>

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Would you say the fear of speaking out is more prevalent
            now than in previous years? And
            if so, why is that the case for this new generation entering the workforce?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>MC</strong></span>: Yeah, I definitely think there is much more fear. Politics
            have become black and
            white, right or left. Social media has made everyone so concerned with how their
            opinions represent them, and no one wants to have their own thoughts and opinions.
            The fear of being wrong holds us back from creative thinking or wanting to state a new
            or unpopular opinion. If we were more focused on having opinions on individual policies
            rather than assigning them “left” or “right”, I believe we’d be less fearful and more open
            to discussion between the “two sides.”</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Would you say we’ve reached a point where this mindset is
            so ingrained in our
            society that clean up isn’t even an option anymore, or is in some ways being actively
            restricted?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>MC</strong></span>: I understand that people are tired and hopeless. I feel
            that way at times. But
            nothing is impossible. Many want change, but politically, we need to focus on vital
            issues: funding poorer neighborhoods and schools, establishing community gardens,
            and tackling survival-based concerns. I always think about the Black Panther Party and
            how they rallied minorities and low-income white folks for basic rights. They were
            painted as dangerous but were in fact the opposite. I benefited from the Free Lunch
            Program from kindergarten to high school, and only learned last year that the Black
            Panther Party started it. I believe in returning to a collectivist mindset and working
            within communities to create change at a base level before tackling broader issues.
            Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs comes to mind: once physiological and safety needs are
            met, we can focus on deeper concerns. By then, theoretically, there’d be less to fix.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>In order to accomplish this, we must understand that this is not an individual fight. We often
                forget that society is built on the relationships we share with one another, and to get back to a
                time where we saw each other as a community shouldn’t just be a dream; it should be a goal.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: If you could give one final message to the readers, what
            would that message be?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>MC</strong></span>: Go outside, touch some grass, and hang out at third places.
            I think the feeling of
            seeing everything online makes people feel connected in a weird way and makes them
            feel like they’re taking action. If people picked up a book, went to an art class, brought
            back book clubs, etc, then those tiny actions in their everyday life would make people
            less fearful to take action on a larger scale. It’d feel less lonely to fight for a labor union
            or to go to a protest because you would know that other people will be there, too. Reject
            the individualistic mindset that society is pushing on you, and remember that, as
            humans, we thrive on interconnectedness.</p>
