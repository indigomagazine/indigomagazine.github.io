            <p>Is the price of being yourself one you’re willing to pay? We often believe it is, holding
                steadfast in our conviction to transform into the best, most authentic versions of
                ourselves while simultaneously saying “screw them, this is my life” to those who would
                oppose. In a perfect world, we would all have the freedom to ignore the outside noise,
                but this isn’t a perfect world. It’s human nature to absorb the opinions of others when
                going through life, often using them as guideposts that alert us if we’re about to fall off a
                cliff. But maybe some of us intended to take a leap, and these opinions actually serve as
                barbed wire, fencing us in and limiting growth. </p>

        <p>Julia understands this feeling all too well, having grown up Catholic and born into a
            multicultural household; her mother is Mexican and her father is a white American from
            Texas. Julia often found it difficult to adhere to the strict teachings of the catholic
            church while also living up to the expectations that were placed on her.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>Susan Eltell</strong></span>: How did being raised Catholic impact you growing
            up?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>Julia Moore</strong></span>: It wasn’t always easy. Growing up, I was always
            asking questions. I
            remember sitting in church and asking, “Why are there no women priests?” I always had
            an inquisitive mind, yet could never connect with the religion no matter how many
            questions I asked.</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: In what ways did you not connect?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>JM</strong></span>: I didn’t like the expectations placed on women in the
            church. We were expected to
            dress a certain way, talk a certain way, and behave a certain way. I felt a lot of pressure
            to adhere to the standards of a large Catholic family. I have 4 older sisters; the oldest
            two aligned more with Catholic traditions, but the rest of us were more disconnected
            from their teachings. Being the youngest, I was always kept in the dark about family
            problems and overall details, so I naturally became very independent. I had to start
            thinking for myself and making my own choices, and eventually, that meant leaving the
            church when I turned fifteen, which I feel very at peace with. </p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>It’s never easy letting go of something you’ve known your whole life, especially with it
                being so tightly intertwined with personal relationships such as family members and a
                community you grew up around. It almost forces you to question whether the worlds we
                are born into are those we’re meant to stay in and if going beyond them defies all laws of
                normality. When she was starting her first year at college, Julia was approached by a
                modeling agency, something she was hesitant to share with her family due to their
                perceptions of it. It’s common for us to still consider the reactions of others when
                embarking on different paths in life, even if their reactions don’t directly impact your
                decision to move forward or not.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Were you expecting a negative reaction?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>JM</strong></span>: Yes, because they had already cut people off for not
            adhering to their standards, so
            I knew what was at stake for me. I hid many parts of the job from my family, only
            sharing what I wanted them to know. For example, modeling in a swimsuit wouldn’t
            have gone over well. The expectations of the culture and church I was raised in were all
            about modesty and the proper ways for women to dress and act, and modeling was not
            within that realm. I didn’t let that stop me, though; I pursued modeling and took the
            opportunity head-on. For me, it was a way to break out of my sheltered environment and
            explore new opportunities. I also saw it as a way to be an advocate for curvy girls in the
            industry, making sure my work allowed them to see themselves on display and be proud
            of the representation.</p>

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>The piper always comes around to collect his debt. Julia takes great pride in her
                modeling, but she knows that living authentically comes at a cost. These repercussions
                often slip into our consciousness discreetly, planting seeds of doubt and guilt for
                choosing a path that is right for us, stirring up an internal storm where shame and doubt
                reside. But under the swarming weight of criticism, there was a blinding light that tore
                through the shadows: the ability to impact. Every single one of us has had the desire to
                leave a mark on the world, a badge of honor that screams “I was here!”. In Julia’s case,
                that mark was her ability to advocate for curvy bodies. The desire to show women with
                her shape that they can be beautiful and proud of themselves was strong enough to
                withstand the disapproval of those around her. And while she’s stood tall in the face of
                harsh winds, the things that take us down are not always visible.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: Do you still feel the lingering effects of the teachings
            shared within the church
            even though you no longer practice the religion?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>JM</strong></span>: Growing up in the church, I constantly heard messages of
            modesty and
            expectations for young girls, and as a curvier person, it was hard for me to accept my
            body and feel confident. There was a lot of religious and emotional manipulation that I
            had to unlearn and overcome, but I refused to let it stop me from pursuing this passion
            and being an advocate for those like me. Modeling is something I’m proud of, but that
            doesn’t mean I don’t still struggle with the stigmas surrounding it. People often think I
            am full of myself and seek to profit off of my body, and I get anxious thinking this
            mindset will transfer into the professional setting when applying for jobs. The inner part
            of me that asks, “Is this appropriate for the workplace?” or “Can I have a career in HR
            with this on my resume?” still speaks to me sometimes. I don’t let those assumptions
            hold me back from doing it, but they leave me filled with anxiety about how it will be
            perceived.</p>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <div class="authors-note">
            <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, everyone carrying a unique gaze that they set upon
                the world. Where one sees freedom and expression, another sees rebellion and
                distastefulness. This way of thinking is common in many cultures and communities,
                limiting the growth and expression of others in the name of preserving some type of
                image, and once you go against that image, you’re seen as a weight tipping the balanced
                scale of conformity. We cannot control the ways in which others will view our choices
                and lifestyles, as hard as we try to. You’re always going to have doubts in the back of
                your head telling you the path you’ve chosen is a lonely one, but once you push past
                them, you’ll free yourself of the societal ties that bind and begin your journey to
                self-acceptance and love. Am I making it sound easier than it is? Possibly. The truth is
                one cannot for sure say whether a journey will work out, but is that any reason not to
                take the risk?</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="dashed-line">

        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>SE</strong></span>: What final message would you like to share with our
            readers?</p><br>
        <p><span class="speaker"><strong>JM</strong></span>: Fight for yourself. I know it’s easier said than done, but
            once you start fighting for
            yourself, you’ll begin the process of taking control of your life. There are many things
            that could have broken me on my path to pursue modeling and breaking away from the
            expectations of those around me, but I pushed on and was able to see the benefit of not
            taking the easy route. I became an advocate for curvy women through my modeling. I
            gained emotional awareness and was able to accept the situations in life that led me to
            this moment without allowing them to define me. So that’s my message: fight for
            yourself and for what you believe is right.</p>
