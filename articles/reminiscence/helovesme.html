The wind blew thick plumes of dirt across the cracked
grass, kicking up dust, rock, and debris in a thin cloud that
staggered across the landscape, muddying the sky. The sun was
high, and the heat stuck sweat to Abigail's face in a sheen.
Across from her, Joseph pressed the tip of his thumb into the
ground, circling the edge of the small hole Abigail had chipped
into the earth, loose rocks tumbling to the bottom. He set his
heels back into the dirt, steadying himself as his small hands
picked apart frail, sun-bleached bones, tossing them down in
the dry divot—plucking, plucking, plucking away until the
remains were stacked cleanly in the small, laughable grave.
There were so many dead things they had buried together. They
didn't kill the rabbit. It had been dead long before the pair had
stumbled upon the body rotting in the backyard. But it didn’t
matter, they had buried the body none the same. No last rites,
no eulogy, but it was buried, and there was nothing left for
them to do.

    Abigail saw her first proper gravestone when she was
eight. It was the middle of a school day, and her mother had
taken her out early for a doctor's appointment. The name on the
headstone was that of a man she had never met. The carefully
carved letters bleached white against the sunbeat marble. She
sat crouched in the grass, tiny white sneakers flecked with dirt
as she picked at the yellow petals of the store-bought bouquet
her mother had told her to hold. Tearing at the delicate body
and watching the pulled petals settle in rhythmic beats. Passing
two phrases back and forth. Back and forth. It was a game one
of the girls at school had taught her. He loves me. He loves me
not.
<br><br>
    Her mother’s words cut cleanly through echoing wind,
her head bowed as she wiped a spot of mud off the grave. "He
was a close friend of mine."
<br><br>
    Abigail continued dropping petals onto the grown-over
lawn. He loves me. He loves me not.
<br><br>
"I wish you could've met him." Abigail's mother
plucked the wiry yellow roses from her hands, resting the frail
flowers in the dark stone vase that melded against the
headstone's front, watching a final petal trickle to the ground
with the movement. He loves me.

    On the drive home, her mother stopped them by a
drive-in restaurant. The air was hot and humid, the sky buzzing
in the southern spring heat. Abigail sat up front, despite not yet
weighing enough for the airbag, and her mother worried her
large diet coke like it was a cigarette.
<br><br>
    Abigail wanted to know about the man. She didn't
understand who or why. She was confused, and Abigail hated
being confused. She tried to pry. How did you know him?
What happened? Who is he? She knew it was rude to ask,
although she didn't have a clue why. She didn't understand why
adults were like that about this kind of thing.
<br><br>
    Her mother kept her gaze steady on the car in front of
them, chewing the top of her plastic red straw like she didn’t
know the answer, and Abigail couldn’t help but pick at the mud
on the bottom of her sneakers, tossing those words across her
brain as the tiny flakes fell onto the gray plastic floor mat. He
loves me. He loves me not. He loves me—
<br><br>
    "He passed away before you were born. It was a motor
accident when he was traveling," Abigail's mother offered,
breaking up the quiet drum of the gravel under the car's tires.
Abigail contended with a rather large flake of mud,
watching it drift to the ground. He loves me not.

    They were caked in mud up to their ankles. Clothes
soaked and then dried in dirty creek water, bleached out by the
sun. It was nearly dark, almost past curfew, and they sat against
the skyline on the deserted playground swings. Joseph chipped
away at the dried dirt crusted on the inner lip of one of the
bottle caps he had fished up from the river bed. It was a red
Coca-Cola cap.
<br><br>
    "I don't think we can be friends anymore." He spoke
plainly, worrying the cap in his hands.
<br><br>
    Abigail kicked her feet against the pine wood padding
at the bottom of the playscape, the rusted metal swing
protesting as it shuddered. She didn't know what to say. She
wanted to ask why, but she knew the answer. Had heard it
spread from friend to friend like wildfire. A girl in their grade
didn't like her. Anna. Abigail had found out about it through
Mary, who was told by Amber, who heard it from Ginny. Anna
said he had to choose one of them. And he had chosen her,
instead.
<br><br>
    "I'm sorry," Joseph pushed the red tin cap into her hand
before pressing off the swings.
Abigail traced the rusted silver edge with her finger, the
sharp lip nicking against the thin skin, causing small drops of
blood to pool and drip into the dirt. He loves me. He loves me
not.

    The air was cooling, humid but not quite hot, and
summer was fading fast. Sixteen going on sixty. She sat under
the beat tin roof of Joseph's shed. It wasn't much a shed
anymore, more so an overhang used to house scrap metal,
rubber tires, and leftover masonry from when the house had
been built, close enough to the edge of the property that it
didn't become an eye sore. Not that there was an HOA to care.
Joseph's arms hung heavily by his sides, back pressed against
one of the metal support beams as he nursed the edge of his
drink. Abigail picked at the tin frame she was perched on,
watching as Joseph eyed the form of a plump squirrel chasing
its way up the neighbor's fence and into a thin, pale tree with
flat ruby leaves.
<br><br>
    "Yeah?" He looked up at her from under his brow.
She straightened, propping herself back onto her arms. "Yeah,
what?"
<br><br>
    "You're watching me."
    "Wanted to know what the buzz was about," she nodded
to the portly squirrel palming the edge of a thick plum.
<br><br>
    Joseph let out a chesty huff, "Doesn't that guy sure
know it."
<br<br>
    He used a hand to propel himself off the dusted floor,
patting his hands down the front of his jeans before crossing
over to the wearing fenceline.
<br><br>
    "Sure, those belong to you?" She called out after him.
    He spun round to face her, keeping his pace as he
stepped backward, "Makes them better."
<br><br>
    She watched as he plucked a cherry red plum dangling
right over the edge of the property line, biting it deep and
exposing the fleshy pink skin inside.
<br><br>   
    "Want a bite?" He pursed his lips in a bemused smile as
he chewed.
<br><br>
    Maybe Eve had not been such a fool after all.

            Life had begun to leak slowly. Drip, drip, dripping
        down the drain. His words toppled over so cleanly.
        <br><br>
            I'm sorry.
            <br><br>
            He wasn't. She knew. He had been with someone else.
        It was always someone else. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Yet
        he was never sorry enough not to do it. Gone and back again as
        it pleased him. She hated him. If only that weren't so similar to
        love. Abigail wanted to scream, to cry, to watch those thick red
        drops drip into the dirt, blossoming tiny red holes into the
        ground. Counting. He loves me. He loves me. He loves me.
        <br><br>
            He loves me not.

    Her mother, soon after, had told her of a young man she
had once known. Twenty years before. They had been engaged,
and then, one day, they weren't. There are so many things left
for me to see. He said. He died a few months later, traveling in
India. Abigail thought back to the thick slab of bleached stone
and the yellow flower petals, and she wondered if that awful
hole in the heart ever closed or if it merely grew softer and
more bearable.
<br><br>
    The evening sun adorned the sky, bright orange
bloodying the countryside. He had the windows down and the
music high as they raced past the rolling fields of southern
summer flowers. Abigail traced the racer red bottle cap of her
soda with her cleanly painted fingernail, eyes fixed on the blue
beauties swaying window side. She could feel Joseph's eyes on
her as he thrummed along to the beat, tinted glasses reflecting
the vibrant summerscape. How many times can someone break
your heart before you stop loving them?

            She knew they were burning gas with every mile,
        burning the little between them they had left. All lovely things
        will die eventually. And well, humanity had already committed
        the sin. What were a few more?
        Joseph clasped his free hand around hers, fingers
        tapping on the wheel one two, one two, to the beat. Abigail
        fixed her eyes on the skyline, bluebonnets dancing against the
        sun, loose petals slipping free and passing in the wind. He
        loves me. He loves me not.
        <br><br>
            The earth's skin cracked cleanly underneath the tufts of
        grass, dying and thin under the rainless summer season.
        Abigail watched the birds overhead, their strained chirps
        creating a listless symphony that drowned the air in childish
        ambiance. It reminded her of a before, when she was a small
        child, sitting under the thick oaks as the katydids sang in time
        with the coursing creek water. Pretty red bottle caps peeking
        through the sand.
        <br><br>
            Poor, foolish, girl. When will you learn.
        She pulled at the edges of a delicate white funeral
        arrangement, needlessly preening the petals, watching the
        smaller, looser ones settle against the crusted earth. She
        counted as they fell. He loves me. She had hoped that maybe
        one day, he would tell her. He loves me not. That the last petal
        would fall, and she could be sure. One. Drip. Two. He loves
        me. One. Drip. Two. He loves me— one.
        He loves me, he loves me not.
