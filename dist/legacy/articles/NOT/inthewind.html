    <h1> In the Wind </h1>

            We sit in the flat patch of dirt in the middle of the field of grass that has slowly become our
            refuge, or maybe it has caged us unknowingly. The wisps of green sway in the wind in harmony
            with her strands of hair, untamed just like the emotions brewing beneath her expressionless face.
            Our hands lay limp beside each other, a detail that sends a pang to my already tight chest. I
            remember when her fingers would cling to mine as if she wished to enter my very skin and
            engrave her name within my flesh. I clutch at the wet ground and hear the squelch of mud make
            its way under my fingernails and cake itself into the swirled pads of my fingertips. The earth has
            ironically acquainted itself with the intricate designs of my skin just as she has. The same earth
            that has left her with a look so worn and beaten that I cannot bring myself to embrace her and
            risk the contagion of her defeat. She opens her mouth and speaks a single phrase without looking
            at me, and I wish I could have seen how the syllables might have changed her fallen expression
            into one anew. But the wind has picked up, and her words are carried into the vast, unrelenting
            world, which has turned its back on us already.

        But, suddenly, the stems of grass still, her unruly hair seems to freeze midair, and I feel as if the
        world has gone silent, though only long enough for me to blink once. My eyes open at the same
        time that the wind rushes towards us, changing direction from the previous northern blow. My
        eyes sting, and the air whistles in my ears. I instinctively hold up my mud-stained hands to feel
        the refreshing wind push through the hollow space between each finger. Then I hear it. A
        declaration that rids me of the unease that had settled into the crevices of my body unbeknownst
        to me. I hear the soft cadences of words tilted with apprehension delivered by the breeze, and
        they settle into the crevices of my ear.

    The earth had relinquished its clutch on her words as if they were too heavy with emotion to be
    held up by the unresolved arms of the delicate air. I look up to see her gaze on me already, and
    once our eyes interlock, it is as if we are pulled together like thread pulled into a knot. Our
    bodies settle into each other like we have been incomplete until this very moment. Though I
    know the existence of our love is like a worn dirt patch within a luscious field of green, our
    embrace filled my pockets with seeds enough to engulf the earth with colors of our own. The
    world has not granted us its approval. We no longer require it.
