        It’s the year 3333 on the exoplanet known as Spe.
        <br><br>
        I often wonder if I am truly capable of love. Not just platonic or familial, but true gut-wrenching,
        die-for-you, romantic love.
        <br><br>
        It’s ironic that my home planet is known colloquially as “where there is hope” because I lost all
        hope years ago.
        <br><br>
        There hasn’t been a time where I haven’t felt like an outsider here. My family’s region of Spe is
        specifically known for love that lasts a lifetime. High school sweethearts in every house on the
        block.
        <br><br>
        You’d assume the same could be said about my parents, and to an extent you’d be right. Except
        they are experts in putting on an adoring doting facade. It’s led me to be practically inept in the
        world of affection.

  <p style="text-align:right;">
        It’s the year 3333 on the exoplanet known as Arion.
        <br><br>
        The notion of love has always deeply fascinated me. Reproduction on Arion is entirely asexual. I
        am my parents, and my parents are me. This sounds more poetic than the reality of this
        statement.
        <br><br>
        Being labeled as an extraterrestrial by the beings on Earth is actually quite fitting. Viewed as an
        alien by outsiders, and viewed the same way by my fellow Arionians.
        <br><br>
        I lack any sort of poetic or musical inclination, unlike every other being here. I’ve begged the
        stars above to show me my true purpose for decades, and yet, I’m stuck in a constant cycle of
        never being enough.
        <br><br>
        My own interest in worlds beyond this one has always been something I’ve kept only to myself. I
        know I’m supposed to be content with what I have, but it’s impossible not to wonder what might
        belong to me outside of all I’ve ever known.

    Planet Spe – Andromeda’s Perspective:
    <br><br>
    Twenty-year-old Andromeda, almost one thousand in Earth years, is unaware of the planets
    outside of her own. Planet Spe is all she has ever known due to strict guidelines to keep Spe’s
    citizens oblivious to anything greater. Spe’s astronomical location is 14 Andromedae b, 249
    million lightyears away from Earth. The collectivist nature of Andromeda’s society has led her to
    feel entirely isolated from any of her peers. She’s unable to develop the close interpersonal
    relationships expected of her due to her independent nature. Andromeda’s inability to assimilate
    has left her to develop her own interests that directly compete with the overriding opinions of the
    rest of the population. She has an all-consuming interest in the sky above. The unyielding curfew
    placed upon all Spe citizens has never stopped Andromeda from sneaking to the highest peak on
    the planet. Here she lies wondering what the twinkling lights above signify; deep in her bones,
    she longs to explore.

        Planet Arion – Orion’s Perspective:
        <br><br>
    Orion’s age is something incalculable in human terms, but know that they are similar in maturity
    to someone in their early 20s. In stark contrast to that of Spe, Arion is known for its limitless
    freedom. There is no governing power. Each individual is left to fend for themselves. You must
    find your particular niche, which is something Orion has yet to discover. Their overcoming
    desire to go beyond the atmosphere of Arion is comparable to that of a human trapped without
    oxygen. Orion believes that anywhere outside of Arion is where they can finally find love. The
    hunger to be understood can only be satisfied by escaping the suffocating individualism. In order
    to cope with this ache, Arion peers through the lens of a telescope hoping someday to stumble
    upon some other world where love radiates from its core.

    Andromeda:
    <br><br>
    I have left home for probably the last time. I can no longer endure the suffocating eyes of my
    parents and so-called “friends”. I am tired of being mocked for my inability to remain in a
    loveless lifeless relationship.
    <br><br>
    None of these childhood friends turned lovers truly cherish each other, they have simply chosen
    to put up with another to appease the higher power. To feed into the falsified belief system that
    ensures an eternal afterlife.
    <br><br>
    I’ve chosen to take only my most precious belongings, the practicality of some may be
    reasonable but I am unable to fully detach from my past. I hold so many versions of myself, so
    many small details I am not ready to relinquish.
    <br><br>
    I head to the only place I deem even somewhat recluse, Mount Amesvern. Here I know I can
    peacefully ruminate on my permanent decision. I have always found such comfort at this peak,
    it’s almost as if the twinkling stars above can really see me. I can almost hear them calling out

        Orion:
        <br><br>
        I’m not sure how long I’ve been away. I stopped keeping track hours ago. It hardly matters
        anyway, there is no one patiently waiting on my inevitable return.
        <br><br>
        I find so much joy sitting in this desolate field with my makeshift humanoid telescope. The
        non-conformist culture of Arion has forced me to devise my own ways to explore worlds outside
        my own.
        <br><br>
        I’ve spent much of tonight fixated on a planet I am unable to classify (yet). All I know is that my
        entire being gravitates towards this planet. It’s as if I am some lost moon separated from its
        orbital routine.
        <br><br>
        The ribbon knotted around my wrists is tugged upon by this unknown planet. Its glowing red
        wispy appearance draws me in like the fluorescent light of twenty-four-hour convenience stores.
        I am unable to take my eyes off the lens of my telescope.

        Andromeda:
        <br><br>
        I’ve tried to convince myself that being alone isn’t comparable to the seven levels of Hell; it’s
        obviously not working. The juxtaposition between my hatred of Spe’s falsified love and my
        dying wish to be wanted is eating away at my tender heart.
        <br><br>
        The barren peak in which I’ve chosen to rest can only offer me comfort by providing warming
        light from the sky above. My father, exiled before my birth, begged my mother to allow him to
        leave me a locked storage unit. Only to be opened on the date of my eighteenth birthday.
        <br><br>
        In my manic packing spree, I chose to bring along my father’s most prized possession, and
        subsequently mine as well. My father was banished due to his insistent curiosity in the galaxies
        and worlds beyond. In keeping my (nonexistent) memory of him alive, I shoved the Orion
        SkyQuest XT10 into my trunk.
        <br><br>
        I have no idea what purpose my father’s outlawed telescope may serve me, but I feel some
        undeniable connection to it. My fingers shake as I take the astronomical tool out of its packaging
        and I can hear my heartbeat in my ears as I begin to peer through the dusted lens.

    Orion:
<br><br>
    I’ve reached a point of no return with my infatuation in Planet Spe. Understandably, I’ve done
    some research since our last check-in. I scoured the markets found on the outskirts of downtown
    in hopes of finding any sort of book on the Andromeda galaxy.
    <br><br>
    To my own dismay, I came across an old friend, who I knew shared the same interest in galaxies
    beyond our own. In hushed voices, I described to him my newfound interest in a particular planet
    that I only assumed had belonged within the Andromeda constellation.
    <br><br>
    Growing up he and I used to peer into the same telescope I use now, without him, it’s unlikely I
    ever would have been able to build anything even remotely useable. I thank him for his years of
    feeding my curiosity, and I head back to the arid fields.
    <br><br>
    I stare up at Spe, wondering what kind of beings must live there, on a planet aptly named after
    the hope that emanates from its mild glow. Although I know my telescope is not comparable to a
    microscope, I swear I can see, or at least feel, someone staring right through me.

    Andromeda:
    <br><br>
    All along I’ve possessed my father’s innate curiosity in astronomy, how could he have known
    this about his unborn child? How could my mother have let me suffer all these years while I
    begged her to show me my purpose on Spe?
    <br><br>
    For the past several days I have done nothing more than sleep, nourish my body, and appease the
    impulse to find the planet where I truly belong.
    <br><br>
    It’s impossible for me to uncover any concrete knowledge related to the alluring sky above. I am
    desperate to gather any information on the beaming blue extrasolar planet that resides in the
    Delphinus constellation.
    <br><br>
    Due to my inability to learn more, I’ve nicknamed this ocean-like orb after my father’s telescope,
    Orion. Consumed by this heavenly body, I swear I can make out a being in the same position as
    me.

    Year 3333 is coming to a close on Planet Arion:
    <br><br>
    Do you ever wish you could speak to your past self? To ease their fears and anxieties about the
    future, to remind them that they have always possessed love, and to hold their hand in times of
    need.
    <br><br>
    I’ve spent the last six months somehow communicating with a being from Planet Spe. Being is a
    lackluster word when I have convinced myself she is the reason I was created. Andromeda, born
    on the planet “where there is hope”. Andromeda, the girl who showed me ambition has always
    resided in me.
    <br><br>
    It’s futile to even attempt to explain our relations or our clairvoyant conversations. Deep within
    both Andromeda and I there exists a piece that belongs to the other. This is my only way of
    understanding our profound connection.
    <br><br>
    I’ve pleaded with her to somehow escape the clenching grasp of Spe’s government, but this is an
    entirely hopeless request.

    Year 3333 is coming to a close on Planet Spe:
    <br><br>
    Why must love only be accessible to me 238 light years away? Am I truly this undeserving of
    love? Is my only experience through the eyes of my own?
    <br><br>    
    Orion has given me, what is likely, my only chance at love. In the months since we’ve “met”,
    they have taught me anything and everything related to the interstellar. Including the correct
    terminology for their home planet, Arion.
    <br><br>
    Our connection is undeniable. Our communication is unexplainable. Our love precedes and
    succeeds our creation. I am unsure how I can continue living, more pessimistically, surviving on
    Spe without Orion’s physical presence.
    <br><br>
    I have yet to discuss this with Orion, and it’s unlikely I will, but I have assured myself this is the
    only answer to sustaining our devotion. I must appeal to the governing power of Spe, I must trust
    in the idea of an eternal afterlife.

    Year 3403 on Planet Arion:
    <br><br>
    It has been seventy years since I last spoke with Andromeda. Each day that has past, 25550 to be
    exact, I have thought nothing other than her ethereal existence.
    <br><br>
    There is no real death on Planet Arion, just a return to the soil of the world that first created me. I
    used to fear the end, a boundless black hole of nothingness. My only source of comfort is the
    memory of Spe’s view on the afterlife.
    <br><br>
    According to my short-lived lover, beings of Spe believe that after death you return to your
    happiest state. Mine is unequivocally my time with Andromeda, and my only hope is that hers is
    her time with me.
    <br><br>
    As my dreary eyes droop close one more time, I am transported to my first interaction with the
    pulsating warmth of Spe. I can once again feel her eyes piercing through my own. The ribbon
    once left untied is now connected to both of our wrists.
